# python-api-challenge

Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?


Instructions
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

API Keys have created a unique connection to obtain Weather and Geo data to draw inferences on the relationships between variables in cities, geo relationships, and more.
